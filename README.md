## Overview

**Duty Station Relocation** is a public, open-source web application that helps U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) job applicants explore potential duty station assignments across the country. It provides a streamlined, responsive interface for browsing, searching, and comparing Border Patrol Duty Stations — helping applicants make better-informed relocation decisions.

Users can access external resources for housing, schools, crime rates, cost of living, weather, and other key relocation factors—right from each station detail page. No login, no tracking, no personal data collected.
